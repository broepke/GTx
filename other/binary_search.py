# Let's implement a binary search using a loop! For now,
# our search will just return True if the item is found,
# False if it's not.

# Like our linear search, our binary search needs to
# parameters: a list to search, and an item to search for.

def binary_search(searchList, searchTerm):
    # First, the list must be sorted.
    searchList.sort()

    # Now, each iteration of the loop, we want to narrow
    # down the part of the list to look at. So, we need to
    # keep track of the range we've narrowed down to so
    # far. Initially, that will be the entire list, from
    # the first index to the last.

    min = 0
    max = len(searchList) - 1

    # Now, we want to loop as long as our range has any
    # numbers left to investigate. As long as there is
    # more than one number between minimum and maximum,
    # we're not done searching.

    while min <= max:

        # We want to check the middle item of the
        # current range, which is the average of the
        # current minimum and maximum index. For
        # example, if min was 5 and max was 15, our
        # middle number would be at index 5. We'll
        # use floor division because indices must be
        # integers.
        currentMiddle = (min + max) // 2

        # If the term in the middle is the term we're
        # looking for, we're done!
        if searchList[currentMiddle] == searchTerm:
            return True

        # If not, we want to check if the term we're
        # looking for should come earlier or later.

        # If the term we're looking for is less than
        # the current middle, then search the first
        # half of the list:
        elif searchTerm < searchList[currentMiddle]:
            max = currentMiddle - 1

        # If the term we're looking for is greater
        # than the current middle, search the second
        # half of the list:
        else:
            min = currentMiddle + 1

        # Each iteration of the loop, one of three
        # things happens: the term is found, max
        # shrinks, or min grows. Eventually, either
        # the term will be found, or min will be
        # equal to max.

    # If the search term was found, this line will
    # never be reached because the return statement
    # will end the function. So, if we get this
    # far, then the search term was not found, and
    # we can return False.
    return False


# Let's try it out!
intlist = [12, 64, 23, 3, 57, 19, 1, 17, 51, 62]
print("23 is in intlist:", binary_search(intlist, 23))
print("50 is in intlist:", binary_search(intlist, 50))

# Want to see something else interesting? Because of
# the way Python handles types, this exact same
# function works for any sortable data type. Check
# it out with strings:
strlist = ["David", "Joshua", "Marguerite", "Jackie"]
print("David is in strlist:", binary_search(strlist, "David"))
print("Lucy is in strlist:", binary_search(strlist, "Lucy"))

# Or with dates!
from datetime import date

datelist = [date(1885, 10, 13), date(2014, 11, 29), date(2016, 11, 26)]
print("10/13/1885 is in datelist:", binary_search(datelist, date(1885, 10, 13)))
print("11/28/2015 is in datelist:", binary_search(datelist, date(2015, 11, 28)))

# Now, go see how it works with recursion instead of loops
# in RecursiveBinarySearch.py! Or, print how this works with
# LoopingBinarySearchwithPrints.py.
