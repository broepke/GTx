# Let's implement Mergesort! This is a complex problem
# because it applies recursion to sorting algorithms, but
# it's also by far the most efficient sorting algorithm we'll
# cover.

# First, we need a function definition: MergeSort should take
# as input one list.

def mergesort(lst):
    # Then, what does it do? mergesort should recursively
    # run mergesort on the left and right sides of lst until
    # it's given a list only one item. So, if lst has only
    # one item, we should just return that one-item list.

    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return lst

    # Otherwise, we should call mergesort separately on the
    # left and right sides. Since each successive call to
    # mergesort sends half as many items, we're guaranteed
    # to eventually send it a list with only one item, at
    # which point we'll stop calling mergesort again.
    else:

        # Floor division on the length of the list will
        # find us the index of the middle value.
        midpoint = len(lst) // 2

        # lst[:midpoint] will get the left side of the
        # list based on list slicing syntax. So, we want
        # to sort the left side of the list alone and
        # assign the result to the new smaller list left.
        left = mergesort(lst[:midpoint])

        # And same for the right side.
        right = mergesort(lst[midpoint:])

        # So, left and right now hold sorted lists of
        # each half of the original list. They might
        # each have only one item, or they could each
        # have several items.

        # Now we want to compare the first items in each
        # list one-by-one, adding the smaller to our new
        # result list until one list is completely empty.

        newlist = []
        while len(left) and len(right) > 0:

            # If the first number in left is lower, add
            # it to the new list and remove it from left
            if left[0] < right[0]:
                newlist.append(left[0])
                del left[0]

            # Otherwise, add the first number from right
            # to the new list and remove it from right
            else:
                newlist.append(right[0])
                del right[0]

        # When the while loop above is done, it means
        # one of the two lists is empty. Because both
        # lists were sorted, we can now add the remainder
        # of each list to the new list. The empty list
        # will have no items to add, and the non-empty
        # list will add its items in order.

        newlist.extend(left)
        newlist.extend(right)

        # newlist is now the sorted version of lst! So,
        # we can return it. If this was a recursive call
        # to mergesort, then this sends a sorted half-
        # list up the ladder. If this was the original
        # call, then this is the final sorted list.

        return newlist


# Let's try it out!
print(mergesort([2, 5, 3, 8, 6, 9, 1, 4, 7]))
