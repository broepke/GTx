# Create four variables name my_integer, my_decimal,
# my_string, and my_boolean. Assign to each variable a
# value of the corresponding type (an integer for
# my_integer, a string of characters for my_string,
# etc.). You can choose whatever values you want --
# just make sure the variable names and types are
# correct!
#
# Then, print the types of each of the four variables
# in order: first the integer, then the decimal
# number, then the string, then the boolean. This
# should print text like <class 'int'>, <class
# 'float'>, and so on.
#
# Don't print anything except their types!


# Create your variables here!
my_integer = 5
my_decimal = 5.1
my_string = "Five!"
my_boolean = True

# Print their types here!
print(type(my_integer))
print(type(my_decimal))
print(type(my_boolean))
