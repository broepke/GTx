# The code below creates a variable named my_int and
# assigns to it a random number from 0 to 10. You
# don't need to worry about how this works; all you
# need to know is that my_int will have an integer
# as its value once this code is done.

import random

my_int = random.randint(0, 10)

# Do not edit the code above!
#
# The line below attempts to print the value of
# my_int, but currently it does not work. Fix
# this code so that it works and prints "The
# current value of my_int is:", followed by the
# value.

print("The current value of my_int is: " + str(my_int))
