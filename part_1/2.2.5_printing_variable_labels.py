my_int1 = 1
my_int2 = 5
my_int3 = 9

# You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
# When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
# assign different values to the variables.
#
# The code above creates three variables: my_int1, my_int2,
# and my_int3. Each will always be an integer
#
# Now, add three lines of code that will print the values
# of those three variables with "my_int1:", "my_int2:", and
# "my_int3:" labeling the output. So, if the variables' values
# were 1, 5, and 9, your lines would print:
#
# my_int1: 1
# my_int2: 5
# my_int3: 9


# Add your lines of code here!
print("my_int1:", my_int1)
print("my_int2:", my_int2)
print("my_int3:", my_int3)

# Next, these lines of code will modify the values of those
# three variables. You don't need to worry about how these
# work. We'll talk about it in the next couple chapters.

my_int1 += 5
my_int2 *= 3
my_int3 **= 2

# Now, copy and paste the same lines from above into the lines
# below. This way, your output will show you the new values of
# these variables.


# Add your lines of code here!
print("my_int1:", my_int1)
print("my_int2:", my_int2)
print("my_int3:", my_int3)

# If your code works correctly, then when run, it should print:
# my_int1: 1
# my_int2: 5
# my_int3: 9
# my_int1: 6
# my_int2: 15
# my_int3: 81
#
# This should be the output when Running. When Submitting,
# we'll test your code with other values of these three
# variables.
