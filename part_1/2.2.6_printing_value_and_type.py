# You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
# When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
# assign different values to the variables.
#
# The code above creates one variable. Right now, it's a
# string, but we might change it to be an integer, a float, or
# something else.
#
# Add a line of code below that will print the variable's value
# and type in a sentence like this:
#
# The value is Hello, world! and the type is <class 'str'>


# Add your lines of code here!
print("The value is", my_variable, "and the type is", type(my_variable))

# When running your code, you should see the message on line
# 14 printed. When submitting, we'll test your code with other
# values and types.
