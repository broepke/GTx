# You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
# When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
# assign different values to the variables.

# Remember, greater than and less than operators can be used to
# compare strings. A string is "less than" another string if it
# comes earlier when sorted alphabetically.
#
# This can have some nuances, though, when it comes to
# capitalization, punctuation, and spaces.
#
# Write some code below that will print True if mystery_string_1
# comes before mystery_string_2 alphabetically according to
# Python, and False if it does not.
#
# While this might be a simple line of code, we'd strongly
# recommend checking out the submission results to see some of
# the odd ways that Python performs. For example, don't be
# surprised when your code says that it's True that "Grapes"
# comes before "apples" alphabetically: Python puts all
# upper-case letters before all lower-case letters.


# Write your code here!
print(mystery_string_1 < mystery_string_2)
