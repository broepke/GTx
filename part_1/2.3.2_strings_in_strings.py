# The 'in' operator can be used to see if a string of characters
# is found within another string of characters, just like it can
# be used to find if an item is in a list.
#
# Above we've created a string with the variable name
# mystery_string. Write some code below that will print True
# if the string "world" appears within mystery_string, and
# False if it does not.


# Write your code here!
