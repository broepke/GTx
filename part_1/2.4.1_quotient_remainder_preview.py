# You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
# When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
# assign different values to the variables.

# The variables above create a dividend and a divisor. Add
# some code below that will print the quotient and remainder
# of performing this operation. The quotient should be the
# whole number, not the decimal number: for example, with the
# original values of dividend and divisor (7 and 3), your code
# should print 2, then 1: 3 goes into 7 two whole times, with
# one left over.
#
# Print the quotient and remainder each on their own line.
# Both values should be integers: there should be no decimals.


# Add your code here!
print(dividend // divisor)
print(dividend % divisor)
