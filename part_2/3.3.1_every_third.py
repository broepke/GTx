# You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
# When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
# assign different values to the variables.

# Write a for loop that prints every third number from 1 to
# mystery_int inclusive (meaning that if mystery_int is 7, it
# prints 1, 4, and 7). Print each number on a separate line.
#
# Hint: There are multiple ways to do this! You might use the
# modulus operators, or you could use the third argument for
# range().


# Add your code here!


for i in range(1, mystery_int + 1, 3):
