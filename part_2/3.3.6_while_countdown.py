# You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
# When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
# assign different values to the variables.

# Use a while loop to create a countdown from mystery_int to
# 0. Count down by 3s: if mystery_int is 46, then you should
# print 46, 43, 40, etc. Do not print any number lower than 0.
# Note that you should print both the original value of
# mystery_int and 0 if you land on it exactly.


# Add your code here!
