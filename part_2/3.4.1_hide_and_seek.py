# Write a function called hide_and_seek. The function should
# have no parameters and return no value; instead, when
# called, it should just print the numbers from 1 through 10,
# follow by the text "Ready or not, here I come!". Each
# number and the message at the end should be on its own
# line.
#
# Then, call the function.
#
# There should be no print statements outside the function.


# Write your function here!
def hide_and_seek():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)
    print("Ready or not, here I come!")


# Call your function here!
