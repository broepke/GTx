# Write a function called after_second that accepts two
# arguments: a target string to search, and string to search
# for. The  function should return everything in the first
# string *after* the *second* occurrence of the search term.
# You can assume  there will always be at least two
# occurrences of the search term in the first string.
#
# For example:
#  after_second("11223344554321", "3") -> 44554321
#
# The search term "3" appears at indices 4 and 5. So, this
# returns everything from the index 6 to the end.
#
#  after_second("heyyoheyhi!", "hey") -> hi!
#
# The search term "hey" appears at indices 0 and 5. The
# search term itself is three characters. So, this returns
# everything from the index 8 to the end.
#
# Hint: This may be more complicated than it looks! You'll
# have to look at the length of the search string and
# either modify the target string or take advantage of the
# extra arguments you can pass to find().


# Write your function here!
def after_second(target_str, search_str):
    first = target_str.find(search_str)
    without_first = target_str[first + len(search_str):]
    second = without_first.find(search_str)
    after_second = without_first[second + len(search_str):]

    return after_second


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print 44554321 and hi!, each on their own line.
print(after_second("11223344554321", "3"))
print(after_second("heyyoheyhi!", "hey"))
