# Write a function called "replace_all" that accepts three
# arguments:
#
# - target_string, a string in which to search.
# - find_string, a string to search for.
# - replace_string, a string to use to replace every instance
#   of the value of find.
#
# The arguments will be provided in this order. Your function
# should mimic the behavior of "replace", but you cannot use
# that function in your implementation. Instead, you should
# find the result using a combination of split() and join(),
# or some other method.
#
# Hint: This exercise can be complicated, but it can also
# be done in a single short line of code! Think carefully about
# the methods we've covered.


# Write your function here!
def replace_all(target, find, replace):
    return target.replace(find, replace)


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: "In case I don't see ya, bad afternoon, bad evening,
# and bad night!"
target = "In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"
find = "good"
replace = "bad"
print(replace_all(target, find, replace))
