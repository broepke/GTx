# Python, like most languages, actually uses numbers in the
# background to represent individual characters in a string.
# For example, "a" is assigned the numeric value of 97.
# We call this the ordinal value. www.asciitable.com shows
# a table of ordinal values: the ordinal value is listed in
# the 'dec' column, and the actual character is listed in
# 'chr' column.
#
# You'll notice, though, that many of the characters here
# are weird. The first 31 are cryptic characters that have
# special meaning to the computer. The extended codes haven't
# really been used since Windows came along. Beyond these
# 255, the higher numbers are actually used to represent
# emojis.
#
# Now, think about when you're asked to create a password.
# Typically, there are restrictions on what characters you
# can use. How do you check if a password is valid? You
# could have a list of valid characters and check each
# character against that list, but that would be a really
# long list. Instead, let's use ordinal values.
#
# Write a function called "valid_char" that determines
# if a single character (a string of length one) has an
# ordinal value corresponding to a valid character for a
# password. Valid characters are any character on the
# keyboard except spaces. Return True if it's a valid
# character, False if it is not.
#
# Hint: you can find the ordinal value of a character using
# the built-in Python function ord(): ord("a") -> 97
#
# Hint 2: the range of legal characters will be one
# continuous range (e.g. characters 55 through 65, not
# separate ranges like 55 through 65 and 69 through 79).
# You can use asciitable.com to look up what range you
# should use.


# Write your function here!
def valid_char(a_string):

    for i in a_string:
        i = ord(i)
        if i >= 33 and i <= 126:
            return True
        else:
            return False

# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: True, False, True, False

print(valid_char("a"))
print(valid_char(" "))
print(valid_char("!"))
print(valid_char("â˜º"))
