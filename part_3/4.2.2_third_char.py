# Write function called third_character that accepts a
# string as an argument and returns the third character
# of the string. If the user inputs a string with fewer than
# 3 characters, return "Too short".


# Write your function here!

# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: 1, o, and "Too short", each on a different line.
