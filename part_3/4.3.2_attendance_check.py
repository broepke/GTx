# Write a function called attendance_check. attendance_check
# should have two parameters: roster and present. Both roster
# and present will be lists of strings. Return a list (sorted
# alphabetically) of all strings in the list roster that are
# not in the list present. In other words, if roster is a
# list of students enrolled in a class and present is a list
# of students in class today, return a list of students that
# are absent.
#
# You may assume that every item in each list will be a
# string. You may also assume that every name in the list
# present will be in the list roster. If no students are
# absent, return an empty list.


# Write your function here!
def attendance_check(roster, present):
    for student in present:
        roster.remove(student)

    roster.sort()

    return roster


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print:
# ['Ferguson', 'Winston']
