# Write a function called grade_scantron. grade_scantron should
# take as input two lists: answers and key. Each list contain
# strings. Each string will be only one letter, a character
# from A to E. grade_scantron should return how many questions
# the student got "right", where a student gets a question
# right if their answer for a problem matches the answer key.
#
# In other words, if value of the first item in answers matches
# the value of the first item in key, the student gets a point.
# If it does not, the student does not get a point.
#
# If the lists do not have the same number of items, return
# -1 to indicate that the answer key did not belong to the
# same test as the student's answers.\
#
# Hint: in the past, lots of people have tried to do this using
# the index() method. That won't work! You'll need to track the
# index yourself.


# Write your function here!
