# Write a function called solve_right_triangle. The function
# solve_right_triangle should have three parameters: opposite,
# adjacent, and use_degrees. opposite and adjacent will be
# floats, and use_degrees will be a boolean. use_degrees
# should be a keyword parameter, and it should have a
# default value of False.
#
# The function should return a tuple containing the
# hypotenuse and angle of the right triangle (in that order).
# If use_degrees is False, the angle should be in radians.
# If use_degrees is True, the angle should be in degrees.
#
# Remember, the formula for the hypotenuse of a right
# triangle is the square root of the sum of the squared side
# lengths. You can find arctan using math.atan(), passing in
# the quotient of the opposite and adjacent as the argument.
# By default, math.atan() returns the angle in radians; you
# can pass that angle as an argument into the math.degrees()
# method to convert it to degrees; for example:
#
# angle_in_degrees = math.degrees(angle_in_radians)


# Write your function here!
def solve_right_triangle(opposite, adjacent, use_degrees=False):
    # angle_in_degrees = math.degrees(angle_in_radians)

    hyp = math.sqrt(opposite ** 2 + adjacent ** 2)
    hyp2 = math.atan(opposite / adjacent)

    print(hyp)
    print(hyp2)

    return hyp
