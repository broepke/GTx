# Write a function called wish_list. wish_list should have
# four parameters, in this order:
#
# - a list of strings, representing a list of items on a
#   wish list
# - a string, representing a particular item
# - a float, representing the cost of this item
# - a float, representing your budget
#
# If the item is on the list and you can afford it (cost is
# less than or equal to budget), return the string,
# "You should buy a [item name]!", replacing [item name]
# with the string.
#
# If the item is on the list but you can't afford it,
# return the string, "You should save up for a [item name]!",
# replacing [item name] with the string.
#
# If the item is not on the list, you should return the
# string "You probably don't want to buy a [item name].",
# replacing [item name] with the string.
#
# HINT: You do not need a loop to solve this. You can use
# one, but you don't need one.


# Add your function here!
