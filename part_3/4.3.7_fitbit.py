# Imagine you're writing some code for an exercise tracker.
# The tracker measures heart rate, and should display the
# average heart rate from an exercise session.
#
# However, the tracker doesn't automatically know when the
# exercise session began. It assumes the session starts the
# first time it sees a heart rate of 100 or more, and ends
# the first time it sees one under 100.
#
# Write a function called average_heart_rate.
# average_heart_rate should have one parameter, a list of
# integers. These integers represent heart rate measurements
# taken 30 seconds apart. average_heart_rate should return
# the average of all heart rates between the first 100+
# heart rate and the last one. Return this as an integer
# (use floor division when calculating the average).
#
# You may assume that the list will only cross the 100 beats
# per minute threshold once: once it goes above 100 and below
# again, it will not go back above.


# Add your function here!
def average_heart_rate(beats):
    counter = 0
    total = 0

    for i in beats:
        if i >= 100:
            counter += 1
            total += i

    return total // counter


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print 114 (because there are 14 measurements from 102 to
# 101, their sum is 1609, and 1609 // 14 is 114).
beats = [72, 77, 79, 95, 102, 105, 112, 115, 120, 121, 121,
         125, 125, 123, 119, 115, 105, 101, 96, 92, 90, 85]
