# This is a long one -- our answer is 20 lines of code, but
# yours will probably be longer. That's because it's one of the
# more authentic problems we've done so far. This is a real
# problem you'll start to face if you want to start creating
# useful programs.
#
# One of the reasons that filetypes work is that everyone
# agrees how they are structured. A ".png" file, for example,
# always contains "PNG" in the first four characters to
# assure the program that the file is actually a png. If these
# standards were not set, it would be hard to write programs
# that know how to open and read the file.
#
# Let’s define a new filetype called ".cs1301".
# In this file, every line should be structured like so:
#
# number assignment_name grade total weight
#
# In this file, each component will meet the following
# description:
#
# - number: an integer-like value of the assignment number
#
# - assignment_name: a string value of the assignment name
#
# - grade: an integer-like value of a student’s grade
#
# - total: an integer-like value of the total possible
#   number of points
#
# - weight: a float-like value ranging from 0 to 1
#   representing the percent of the student’s grade this
#   assignment is worth. All the weights should add up to 1.
#
# Each component should be separated with exactly one space.
# A good sample file is available to view as
# "sample.cs1301".
#
# Write a function called format_checker that accepts a
# filename and returns True if the file contents accurately
# conform to the described format. Otherwise the function
# should return False. In other words, it should return True
# if:
#
# - Each line has five elements separated by spaces, AND
# - The first, third, and fourth elements are integers, AND
# - The fifth element is a decimal number, AND
# - All the fifth elements add to 1.
#
# You can make changes to test.cs1301 to test your function,
# or test it with sample.cs1301. Right now, running it on
# sample.cs1301 should return True, and on test.cs1301
# should return False.
#
# Hint 1: .split() will likely help separate each line into
# its components.
# Hint 2: .split() returns a list. So, if you were to do
# something like say split_line = line.split(), then
# split_line[0] would give the first item, split_line[1] would
# give the second item, etc.
# Hint 3: If you're having trouble, try breaking it down by
# parts. First check the file to see if it has the right
# number of items per line, then whether the items are of
# the correct type, then whether the fifth elements add to
# 1. Remember, you know how to do each individual check
# (checking types, adding numbers, finding list lengths) --
# the hard part is knitting this all together into one bigger
# solution.


# Write your function here!
