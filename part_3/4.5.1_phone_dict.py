# Write a function called phonebook that takes two lists as
# input:
#
# - names, a list of names as strings
# - numbers, a list of phone numbers as strings
#
# phonebook() should take these two lists and create a
# dictionary that maps each name to its phone number. For
# example, the first name in names should become a key in
# the dictionary, and the first number in numbers should
# become the value corresponding to the first name. Then, it
# should return the dictionary that results.
#
# Hint: Because you're mapping the first name with the first
# number, the second name with the second number, etc., you do
# not need two loops. For a similar exercise, check back on
# Coding Problem 4.3.3, the Scantron grading problem.
#
# You may assume that the two lists have the same number of
# items: there will be no names without numbers or numbers
# without names.


# Write your function here!
def phonebook(names, numbers):
    book = {}
    i = 0

    for i in range(len(names)):
        book[names[i]] = numbers[i]

    return book


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print (although the order of the keys may vary):
# {'Jackie': '404-555-1234', 'Joshua': '678-555-5678', 'Marguerite': '770-555-9012'

name_list = ['Jackie', 'Joshua', 'Marguerite']
number_list = ['404-555-1234', '678-555-5678', '770-555-9012']
print(phonebook(name_list, number_list))
