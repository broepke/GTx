# Do not change the line of code below. It's at the top of
# the file to ensure that it runs before any of your code.
# You will be able to access french_dict from inside your
# function.
french_dict = {"me": "moi", "hello": "bonjour",
               "goodbye": "au revoir", "cat": "chat",
               "dog": "chien", "and": "et"}


# Write a function called french2eng that takes in one string
# parameter called sentence. french2eng should look at each
# word in the sentence and translate it into French if it is
# found in the dictionary, french_dict. If a word is not found
# in the dictionary, do not translate it: use the original
# word. Then, the function should return a string of the
# translated sentence.
#
# You may assume that the sentence you're translating has no
# punctuation. However, you should convert it to lower case
# before translating.
#
# For example:
#
#  french2eng("Hello it's me") -> "bonjour it's moi"
#
# Hint: Use .split() to get a list of strings representing
# each word in the string, then use ' '.join to merge the
# translated list back into one string.
#
# Hint 2: Remember, lists are mutable, so we can change
# individual items in the list. However, to change an item
# in a list, we must change it using its index. We can
# write lines like my_words[1] = new_word.
#
# Hint 3: If you're stuck, try breaking it down into small
# parts. How do you access an item from a list? How do you
# look up a key in a dictionary? How do you change the
# value of an item in a list? How do you check if a key is
# in the dictionary?


# Write your function here!
def french2eng(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    word_list = sentence.split()

    for word in word_list:
        if word in french_dict.keys():
            sentence = sentence.replace(word, french_dict[word])

    return sentence


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: bonjour it's moi
print(french2eng("Hello it's me"))
