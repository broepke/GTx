# Write a function called modify_dict. modify_dict takes one
# parameter, a dictionary. The dictionary's keys are people's
# last names, and the dictionary's values are people's first
# names. For example, the key "Joyner" would have the value
# "David".
#
# modify_dict should delete any key-value pair for which the
# key's first letter is not capitalized. For example, the
# key-value pair "joyner":"David" would be deleted, but the
# key-value pair "Joyner":"david" would not be deleted. Then,
# return the modified dictionary.
#
# Remember, the keyword del deletes items from lists and
# dictionaries. For example, to remove the key "key!" from
# the dictionary my_dict, you would write: del my_dict["key!"]
# Or, if the key was the variable my_key, you would write:
# del my_dict[my_key]
#
# Hint: If you try to delete items from the dictionary while
# looping through the dictionary, you'll run into problems!
# We should never change the number if items in a list or
# dictionary while looping through those items. Think about
# what you could do to keep track of which keys should be
# deleted so you can delete them after the loop is done.
#
# Hint 2: To check if the first letter of a string is a
# capital letter, use string[0].isupper().


# Write your function here!
def modify_dict(a_dict):
    to_delete = []

    for last_names in a_dict.keys():
        if not last_names[0].isupper():
            to_delete.append(last_names)

    for names in to_delete:
        del a_dict[names]

    return a_dict


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print (although the order of the keys may vary):
#  {'Diaddigo':'Joshua', 'Elliott':'jackie'}
my_dict = {'Joshua': 'Diaddigo', 'joyner': 'David', 'Elliott': 'jackie', 'murrell': 'marguerite'}
print(modify_dict(my_dict))
