# Write a function called word_lengths, which takes in one
# parameter, a string, and returns a dictionary where each
# word of the string is mapped to an integer representing how
# how long that word is. You should ignore punctuation, and
# all the words should be lowercase. You can assume that the
# only punctuation marks in the string will be periods,
# commas, question marks, exclamation points, and apostrophes.
#
# For example:
#  word_lengths("I ate a bowl of cereal out of a dog bowl today.")
#  -> {'i':1, 'bowl':4, 'today':5, 'out':3, 'dog':3, 'ate':3,
#      'a':1, 'of':2, 'cereal':6}
#
# Hint: Use the split() method to split by spaces, and don't
# forget to remove punctuation marks.  Remember also: strings
# are immutable, so operations like my_string.lower() don't
# change the value of my_string like list methods: to save
# those results, you'd write my_string = my_string.lower().
#
# Your dictionary should not have any duplicate keys (in fact,
# Python won't allow a dictionary to have duplicate keys).


# Write your function here!
def word_lengths(a_string):
    a_string = a_string.replace(".", "")
    a_string = a_string.replace("!", "")
    a_string = a_string.replace("'", "")
    a_string = a_string.replace(",", "")
    a_string = a_string.replace("?", "")
    a_string = a_string.lower()

    string_list = a_string.split()
    string_dict = {}

    for word in string_list:
        string_dict[word] = len(word)

    return string_dict


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print:
# {'dog': 3, 'today': 5, 'of': 2, 'ate': 3, 'bowl': 4, 'out': 3, 'a': 1, 'cereal': 6, 'i': 1}
#
# The order of the keys may differ, but that's okay!
print(word_lengths("I ate a bowl of cereal out of a dog bowl today."))
