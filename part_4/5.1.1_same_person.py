# Below is a class representing a person. You'll see the
# Person class has three instance variables: name, age,
# and GTID. The constructor currently sets these values
# via a calls to the setters.
#
# Create a new function called same_person. same_person
# should take two instances of Person as arguments, and
# returns True if they are the same Person, False otherwise.
# Two instances of Person are considered to be the same if
# and only if they have the same GTID. It does not matter
# if their names or ages differ as long as they have the
# same GTID.
#
# You should not need to modify the Person class.
