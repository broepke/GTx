# The Fibonacci sequence is a number sequence where each
# number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first
# two numbers are defined as 0 and 1, so the third number is
# 1 (0 + 1 = 1), the fourth number is 2 (1 + 1 = 2), the
# fifth number is 3 (1 + 2 = 3), the sixth number is 5
# (2 + 3 = 5), and so on.
#
# Below we've started a class called FibSeq. At any time,
# FibSeq holds two values from the Fibonacci sequence:
# back1 and back2.
#
# Create a new method inside FibSeq called next_number. The
# next_number method should:
#
# - Calculate and return the next number in the sequence,
#   based on the previous 2.
# - Update back2 with the former value of back1, and update
#   back1 with the new next item in the sequence.
#
# This means that consecutive calls to next_number should
# yield each consecutive number from the Fibonacci sequence.
# Calling next_number 5 times would print 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.


class FibSeq:
    def __init__(self):
        self.back1 = 1

        number = self.back1 + self.back2
        self.back2 = self.back1
        self.back1 = number

        return number


# The code below will test your method. It's not used for
# grading, so feel free to change it. As written, it should
# print 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
