# We've started a recursive function below called
# measure_string that should take in one string parameter,
# myStr, and returns its length. However, you may not use
# Python's built-in len function.
#
# Finish our code. We are missing the base case and the
# recursive call.
#
# HINT: Often when we have recursion involving strings, we
# want to break down the string to be in its simplest form.
# Think about how you could splice a string little by little.
# Then think about what your base case might be - what is
# the most basic, minimal string you can have in python?
#
# Hint 2: How can you establish the base case has been
# reached without the len() function?

# You may not use the built-in 'len()' function.

def measure_string(myStr):
    if myStr == "":
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + measure_string(myStr[:-1])


# The line below will test your function. As written, this
# should print 13. You may modify this to test your code.
print(measure_string("13 characters"))
