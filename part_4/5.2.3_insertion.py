# Recall in the lesson on sorts that we had you complete the
# Bubble and Selection sort, and we showed you Merge sort.
# We didn't show any of insertion sort, and I bet you can
# guess why.
#
# Implement insertion sort below.
#
# Name your function 'insertion'. insertion should take as
# input a list, and return as output a sorted list. Note that
# even though technically a sorting method does not have to
# return the sorted list, yours should.
#
# If you're stuck on where to start, or having trouble
# visualizing or understanding how exactly insertion sort
# works, check out this website - https://visualgo.net/sorting
# It provides a visual representation of all of the sorting
# algorithms as well as pseudocode you can base your own code
# off of.


# Write your code here!
def insertion(alist):

    for index in range(1, len(alist)):

        currentvalue = alist[index]
        position = index

        while position > 0 and alist[position - 1] > currentvalue:
            alist[position] = alist[position - 1]
            position = position - 1

        alist[position] = currentvalue

    return alist



# The code below will test your function. If your function
# works, it will print: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
print(insertion([2, 5, 3, 1, 4]))
